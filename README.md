Hello this is John and this is my first git project. I am attempting to write a git workflow using git commands in the process for practice.

Step 1.
Make some changes to your file. Then to show that git hasn't staged your changes yet type the command git status

Once you are satisfied with the changes you made add file to staging by typing in the command git add filename
